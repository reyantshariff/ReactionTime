Reaction Time Test
This is a simple Java Swing application for testing reaction time. The application presents a button to the user, and upon clicking, it measures the time it takes for the user to react to a visual cue.

How to Use
Run the ReactionTime class.
Click the "Click to Begin the Reaction Time Test" button.
Wait for the screen to turn green.
Click again when the screen turns green.
The application will display your reaction time in milliseconds.
Code Overview
The code uses Java Swing for the graphical user interface. Here's a brief overview:

The ReactionTime class initializes the GUI and handles user interaction.
The createAndShowGUI method sets up the main frame, button, and panel.
The begin method initiates the test by setting up a timer to change the panel color to green after a random timeout.
The reaction time is measured when the user clicks the button after the screen turns green.
Notes
The application is designed to be run in full-screen mode (setExtendedState(JFrame.MAXIMIZED_BOTH) and setUndecorated(true)).
The user is prompted to click the button after the screen turns green, and their reaction time is displayed.
Feel free to use, modify, and contribute to this simple reaction time test!
